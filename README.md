The first purpose of this project was to be an illustration of polymorphism and inheritance for the Programming II Course, where we studied C and C++. Afterward, at the Advanced Data Structures Course, we were asked to modify it, changing the structure that we used to store the data to one or more structures that we studied at this course.
