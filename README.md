# Pharmacy management program

The first purpose of this project was to be an illustration of polymorphism and inheritance for the Programming II Course, where we studied C/C++. Afterward, at the Advanced Data Structures Course, we were asked to modify it, changing the structure that we used to store the data to one or more structures that we studied at this course.

## Functionalities

This project offers its users the possibility to manage a pharmacy storage. It implements the insert, update, delete and search operations for the products. Additionally, it allows sorting and filtering by diverse criteria. 

## Data structures

The main data structure that I decided to use is a red-black tree due to its O(log n) worst time complexity for the base operations. It also allows me to get the products sorted
after the key(their name) in linear time.
